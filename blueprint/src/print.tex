% This file makes a printable version of the blueprint
% It should include all the \usepackage needed for the pdf version.
% The template version assume you want to use a modern TeX compiler
% such as xeLaTeX or luaLaTeX including support for unicode
% and Latin Modern Math font with standard bugfixes applied.
% It also uses expl3 in order to support macros related to the dependency graph.
% It also includes standard AMS packages (and their improved version
% mathtools) as well as support for links with a sober decoration
% (no ugly rectangles around links).
% It is otherwise a very minimal preamble (you should probably at least
% add cleveref and tikz-cd).

\title{Zsigmondy's Theorem for Chebyshev Polynomials}
\author{Stefan Barańczuk (formalized by Bartosz Naskręcki via Aristotle)}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  For an integer $a$ consider the divisibility sequence $s_{n}=T_{n}(a)-1$ defined by the
  Chebyshev polynomials $T_{n}$. We list all values of $a$ and $n$ for which the
  term $s_{n}$ has no primitive prime divisor. This result is a pendant to the classic
  Zsigmondy's Theorem, an analogous result for power maps.
